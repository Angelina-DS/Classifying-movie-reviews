# Classifying movie reviews
Machine-learning problem where one have to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews. <br>

To do so, we'll work on the IMDB dataset : a set of 50 000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The dataset is plit into 25 000 reviews for training and 25 000 reviews for testing, each set consisting of 50% negative and 50% positive reviews. <br>

The IMDB dataset has already been preprocessed : the reviews (sequences of words) have been turned into sequences of integers, where each integer stands for a specific word in a dictionnary.
